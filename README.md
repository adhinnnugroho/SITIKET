# Overview

Sitiket is a ticketing application that I developed as part of my graduation requirement from SMKN 1 Bawang. This application is designed to simplify the process of booking travel tickets, including trains, flights, and other forms of transportation.

Initially, Sitiket was developed using CodeIgniter 4 (CI4). However, due to the lack of documentation and changing requirements, I decided to rewrite the application using more modern technology. This rewrite provided an opportunity to enhance the application's quality, update the technologies used, and implement better software development practices.

# ⚠️ Project Status
Note: This application is currently under development and is not yet 100% complete. Some features may be missing or incomplete. Contributions and feedback are welcome as the project continues to evolve.
